				</p>
				<hr class="my-4">
				<p>Rules</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Each player has 16 pieces, including one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and
						eight pawns.</li>
					<li>The objective is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning the king is in a position to be captured
						(in check) and cannot escape capture (mate).</li>
					<li>Pieces have specific movement rules: for example, pawns move forward one square but capture
						diagonally, rooks move horizontally or vertically, knights have an L-shaped move, etc.</li>
					<li>The game ends in a draw under various conditions, including a stalemate or insufficient material for
						checkmate.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For more detailed rules and strategies, you can explore chess tutorials and books.</p>
